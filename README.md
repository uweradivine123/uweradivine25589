1. What is Logging?
Logging is the process of recording information about the execution of a program. It typically involves writing messages to a log file or console to provide insight into the application's behavior and state. These messages can include details about normal operations, errors, warnings, and other significant events.

2. Why Logging is Important
Logging is crucial for several reasons:

Debugging: Helps identify and troubleshoot issues within an application by providing detailed information about the application's behavior at runtime.
Monitoring: Enables the tracking of application performance and health, ensuring that it operates smoothly.
Audit Trail: Creates a record of events and changes, which can be useful for security audits and compliance purposes.
Analysis: Provides data for analyzing application usage patterns and identifying potential improvements.
Error Handling: Captures errors and exceptions, allowing developers to address and fix problems more efficiently.
3. Understanding Logging Levels
Logging levels categorize the importance and type of messages logged. Common logging levels include:

DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems. Used for development and debugging.
INFO: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a high level. Used for general operational messages.
WARNING: Potentially harmful situations or events that are not necessarily errors but could cause problems in the future. Used to indicate a possible issue.
ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running. Used to indicate serious problems that need attention.
CRITICAL or FATAL: Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort. Used for critical failures that require immediate attention.
